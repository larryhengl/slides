So the next slides will step thru a basic example approaching those prior questions.  In particular, we look at how to query data from Neo4, using Cypher, and how that stacks up to SQL.  I loaded the ONCNET data from the RDBMS we used, into Neo4j, using py2neo (thanks Nige/@technige !) and the batch importer (thanks Michael/@mesirii !) and awesome examples from Max De Marzi (thanks @maxdemarzi !). 700K nodes, ~1.2M edges, forgot how many properties (1.5M+?).

The associations were precomputed outside the DB using bioinfo tools and scripts written in R and Perl, and loaded into the DB as nodes.  The SQL ran off the page.  The graph was neat in that it moved around on the screen while I talked as the repulsion calcs were running for the layout.  They were situatin'. It shows the query gene and it's features clustered in the center and the associated-feature nodes enveloping the outside.  On our way to a Hairball...funtimes."},
      {"img":"21.png","note":"This cypher query was an attempt at community detection.  It finds genes that were connected to the associated-feature nodes which are connected to the original query gene.  This one took A Little While&#8482; to execute in practice, so I cheated and fudged the model a tad to help make the query dynamic and near-instant for the impatient folks in the session (remember the Goals at the top?).  There were weights and thresholds and filters and aggregations involved to determine the top set of connected genes with the highest number of evidences (depicted as node size in the graph).  The cypher certainly could be optimized, as could the SQL that I intentionally chose not to show because the sub-query nesting and self-joins were hideous.  This would be a fun query to come back to in a production setting, with larger data sets, to look at metrics and optimization patterns."},

        <p>Snaps of slides I presented at an internal Novartis informatics conference. Presented to scientists and IT folks. <br/><b>Covers Cypher in a Bioinformatics context</b>.</p>
        <p>Goals: Be as out-of-the-box as possible. High level. Stir some interest and keep it entertaining.</p>
        <p>Notes: This was presented using reveal.js. The prez and discussion were very interactive so some context may be less clear by just looking at the slides - perhaps the notes can help. The Cypher statements were live editable and dynamically run against a Neo4j DB loaded on the same laptop I presented with (700K nodes, 1.2M edges). The results were rendered as force-directed graphs using D3 embedded in the presentation.</p>
